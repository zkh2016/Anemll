# ANEMLL

**ANEMLL** (pronounced like "animal") is an open-source project focused on accelerating the porting of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tensor processors, starting with the Apple Neural Engine (ANE).

The goal is to provide a fully open-source pipeline from model conversion to inference for common LLM architectures running on ANE.

This enables seamless integration and on-device inference for low-power applications on edge devices, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

This is critical for autonomous applications, where models run directly on the device without requiring an internet connection.

## License

ANEMLL is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
The original model may require a separate license depending on the architecture:
- LLaMA models: Based on Meta's LLaMA and may require Meta's license
- Qwen models: Based on Alibaba's Qwen and may require Alibaba's license
- Gemma models: Based on Google's Gemma and subject to Gemma Terms of Use
- Other models: Check respective original model licenses

This model is converted for CoreML using ANEMLL's open-source conversion pipeline. It supports multiple LLM architectures including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, and DeepSeek variants.

## Requirements

- **macOS 15 (Sequoia)** or later with Apple Neural Engine and 8GB RAM or more
- **CoreML Tools 9.x+** and **HuggingFace Transformers** libraries
- **Python 3.9+**

`chat.py` provides a sample inference script.  
`chat_full.py` provides a sample inference script with history and conversation management.  

**Installation**

1. Download the model from Hugging Face:
```bash
# Install required tools
pip install huggingface_hub

# Install Git LFS (Large File Support)
# macOS with Homebrew:
brew install git-lfs
# Or Ubuntu/Debian:
# sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install

# Clone the repository with model files
git clone https://huggingface.co/%HF_ORG%/%NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER_WE_UPLOAD%
```

2. Extract model files:
```bash
# Navigate to cloned directory
cd %NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER_WE_UPLOAD%

# Pull LFS files (model weights)
git lfs pull

# Extract CoreML model files
find . -type f -name "*.zip" -exec unzip {} \;
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install "coremltools>=9.0" transformers
```

**Coremltools:**

See coremltools installation guide at https://apple.github.io/coremltools/docs-guides/source/installing-coremltools.html 

**How to Run**

1. Basic chat interface:
```bash
python chat.py --meta %PATH_TO_META_YAML%
```

2. Full conversation mode with history:
```bash
python chat_full.py --meta %PATH_TO_META_YAML%
```

> Note: The first time the model loads, macOS will take some time to place it on the device.
> Subsequent loads will be instantaneous.
> Use Ctrl-D to exit, Ctrl-C to interrupt inference.

# %NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER_WE_UPLOAD%

This is a CoreML model converted using ANEMLL for Apple Neural Engine inference.

## Available Distributions

### Standard Distribution
- Contains zipped MLMODELC files
- Suitable for macOS and development

### iOS Distribution
- Contains unzipped MLMODELC files
- Ready for iOS deployment
- Includes offline tokenizer support

## Model Information
- Context Length: %CONTEXT_LENGTH%
- Batch Size: %BATCH_SIZE%
- Number of Chunks: %NUM_CHUNKS%
- LUT Quantization: %LUT_BITS%

## Quick Start

### Test in iOS/macOS App
Try our sample Chat-Bot app on TestFlight:
1. Install TestFlight from App Store
2. Join beta test: [TestFlight Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/jrQq1D1C)
3. App includes a small demo model pre-installed
4. You can add custom models via HuggingFace URLs

> [!Note]
> - The TestFlight app works on both iOS and macOS
> - Demonstrates proper model integration and provides a reference implementation
> - iOS requires unzipped MLMODELC files and config.json for offline tokenizer
> - macOS supports both zipped and unzipped model formats
